# Lorentztr
Here we have the code for the lorentz transformation in an integer version for FPGA applications.

In `momentum.py` you can find the user-defined type for momentum, defined as: 3 integer variable and some operators overloadings.

In `Lorentztr.py` you can find the Lorentz integer tranformation algorithm.
